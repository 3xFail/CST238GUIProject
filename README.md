<b>Description:</b>

This is a GUI project that I will be using to complete the requirements to of my class. Currently undecided on the technologies that will be involed in the project. But the main idea I have right now is a tennis match tracking app that could be used my players or stat keepers to keep track of the missed shots and points for the current match aswell as a log to track your pervious actions in other matches 

<b>Technologies:</b>

QT with C++ coding behind

<b>Inspiration:</b>

My insperation for this idea came out of annoyance. You always want to try to get better at things you like. For me that is tennis, but after a match I could only think over one or two points that really bugged me. Without anyway to remember the events of the match, short of a spectator writing them down for you, there was know way to know what you should focus practicing on todo better. With this players can have a accurate idea of what they may need to focus more on in practices.
